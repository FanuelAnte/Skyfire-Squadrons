### How did WW2 fighter pilots manage the throttle and prop pitch during dogfight?
You may have heard the term “Balls To The Wall”, meaning to go all out or to take something to the extreme. Stupid people in the press always take this to mean something having to do with testicles. In fact, it refers to the levers on the throttle quadrant of aircraft like a WW2 fighter; i.e. Throttle, Propeller Pitch (RPM), and Mixture plus usually some kind of control over the super charger. They are typically mounted on the left side of the cockpit and the ends of these levers traditionally had round knobs at the top, hence the term “balls”.

In cruise flight, especially at high altitude you would carefully modulate the throttle, rpm, mixture, and supercharger drive ratio to give the best cruise performance. For example, without full load on the engine, it is desirable to lean out the mixture to save fuel while selecting some combination of prop pitch and throttle setting to give good speed and range. This is something like driving your Corvette at freeway speeds in 6th gear when your engine might be loping along at only 1500 rpm and the engine management computer is leaning out the mixture to the point where your instantaneous MPG reading will be in the high 20s.

But for performance you would likely downshift your Corvette to a lower gear, use a lot more throttle, and the engine computer would use a richer fuel mixture. Likewise, when the WW2 fighter pilot found himself engaged in a dog fight, he would essentially push all the levers on his throttle quadrant forward to get more throttle opening, more rpm, and a richer fuel mixture. In an all out effort to achieve maximum performance the levers (the ones with the little balls on top) would be pushed all the way forward toward the firewall. In other words, “Balls To The Wall”.

### Do military planes always run at full throttle?
Do you drive your car with the gas pedal fully depressed all the time? No, of course not. But you do fully depress it if you want a quick start from standing, passing someone quickly, or merging onto a high speed expressway.

Military planes are the same way. They use military rated thrust (i.e. MRT) on takeoff, when maneuvering, when executing a missed approach, and at other moments where full power is required. In between, the aircraft is typically flying at either max endurance or max range airspeed which require much less than MRT.

All aircraft, military included, must actively manage their fuel. There are only a few places you can land, and you can’t just pull off to the side of the road if you run out of gas. So fuel management is always top of mind, and that means flying at well below MRT.

Sometimes you have to stay aloft for as long as possible.

Military planes do not always run at full throttle, but only when they need to. Full throttle is the maximum power setting of the engine, which produces the highest thrust and speed. Full throttle also consumes more fuel and causes more wear and tear on the engine. That's why military planes usually run at lower power settings for normal operations, such as cruising, patrolling, or training.

There are some situations where military planes need to run at full throttle, such as taking off, climbing, intercepting, escaping, or engaging in combat. In these situations, speed and performance are more important than fuel efficiency and engine life. For example, a fighter jet may need to run at full throttle to take off from a short runway or an aircraft carrier, or to catch up with an enemy plane or missile.

Some military planes have even higher power settings than full throttle, such as afterburner or war emergency power (WEP). Afterburner is a system that injects extra fuel into the exhaust of a jet engine, creating more thrust and speed. Afterburner also consumes much more fuel and generates more heat and noise. Hence afterburner is only used for short bursts of speed, such as during dogfights or supersonic flight.
### War emergency power
**War emergency power** (**WEP**) is a [throttle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Throttle "Throttle") setting that was first present on some American [World War II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II "World War II") military [aircraft engines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_engine "Aircraft engine"). For use in emergency situations, it produced more than 100% of the engine's normal [rated power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rated_power "Rated power") for a limited amount of time, often about five minutes.
#### WEP in World War II aircraft
Maximum normal power would be limited by a mechanical stop, for instance a wire across the throttle lever slot. A more forceful push would break the wire, allowing extra power. In normal service, the [P-51H Mustang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-51_Mustang "P-51 Mustang") was rated at 1,380 hp (1,030 kW), but WEP would deliver up to 2,218 hp (1,654 kW),[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_emergency_power#cite_note-p51wep-3) an increase of 61%. In the [P-51D Mustang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-51_Mustang "P-51 Mustang"), the model most produced and used during World War II, the WEP increased engine power from 1,490 to 1,720 hp (1,110 to 1,280 kW). The [Vought F4U Corsair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vought_F4U_Corsair "Vought F4U Corsair"), not originally equipped for WEP, later boasted a power increase of up to 410 hp (310 kW) (17%) when WEP was engaged.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_emergency_power#cite_note-corsair-2) Several methods were used to boost engine power by manufacturers, including [water injection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_injection_(engines) "Water injection (engines)") and [methanol-water injection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MW50 "MW50"). Some earlier engines simply allowed the throttle to open wider than normal, allowing more air to flow through the [intake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intake "Intake"). All WEP methods result in greater-than-usual stresses on the engine, and correspond to a reduced engine lifetime. For some airplanes, such as the P-51D, use of WEP required that the engine be inspected for damage before returning to the air.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_emergency_power#cite_note-P-51_Mustang_1945,_p.14-4) 5 hours' total use of WEP on the P-51D required a complete tear-down inspection of the engine.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_emergency_power#cite_note-P-51_Mustang_1945,_p.14-4)

British and Commonwealth aircraft could increase power by increasing the supercharger boost pressure.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_emergency_power#cite_note-AirPerformance-5) This modification was common by the summer of 1940, with the widespread availability of [100 octane fuel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_of_the_Battle_of_Britain#100_octane_aviation_fuel "Aircraft of the Battle of Britain"). Raising supercharger boost pressure from 6 to 12 psi (41 to 83 kPa)[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_emergency_power#cite_note-AirPerformance-5) increased the [Merlin III](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Rolls-Royce_Merlin_variants "List of Rolls-Royce Merlin variants") engine rating to 1,310 hp (980 kW), an increase of over 250 horsepower (190 kW). Pilots had to log the use of emergency boost and were advised not to use it for more than 5 minutes continuously.

The German [MW 50](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MW_50 "MW 50") methanol-water injection system required additional piping, as well as a storage tank, increasing the aircraft's overall weight.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_emergency_power#cite_note-db605-6) Like other boost techniques, MW 50 was restricted by capacity and engine temperatures and could only be used for a limited time. The [GM 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GM_1 "GM 1") nitrous oxide injection system, also used by the [Luftwaffe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luftwaffe "Luftwaffe"), provided extreme power benefits of 25 to 30 percent at high altitude by adding oxidizer gases but required cooling on the ground and, like the MW 50 boost system, added significant weight.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_emergency_power#cite_note-db605-6) One of the few German aircraft that could be equipped with both _Notleistung_ systems, the late war [Focke-Wulf Ta 152](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focke-Wulf_Ta_152 "Focke-Wulf Ta 152")H high-altitude fighter, could attain a velocity of some 470 mph (756 km/h) with both systems used together. [Kurt Tank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_Tank "Kurt Tank") reportedly once did this, using both boost systems simultaneously when he was flying a [Junkers Jumo 213](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junkers_Jumo_213 "Junkers Jumo 213")E-powered Ta 152H prototype fitted with both MW 50 and GM-1, to escape a flight of P-51D Mustangs in April 1945.

### How do G-Forces affect pilots
G-forces, or gravitational forces, can have various effects on a pilot's body due to the acceleration they experience during flight maneuvers. The impact of G-forces depends on their magnitude, direction, and duration. Here are some effects G-forces can have on a pilot:
1. Cardiovascular Effects: G-forces can cause blood to be forced away from the brain and towards the lower parts of the body. This can result in a decrease in blood supply to the brain, leading to a condition known as "G-induced loss of consciousness" (G-LOC). To mitigate this, pilots are trained to perform anti-G straining maneuvers, such as tensing their leg and abdominal muscles and performing breathing techniques.

2. Vision Impairment: High G-forces can also affect vision. As blood is forced away from the head, pilots may experience a reduction in peripheral vision, tunnel vision, or even temporary blindness. These effects can be mitigated by using specialized equipment like G-suits that apply pressure to the lower body to prevent blood pooling.

3. Muscular Strain: Sustained exposure to high G-forces can strain the pilot's muscles, particularly in the neck, back, and legs. This can lead to fatigue and discomfort, potentially affecting their ability to operate the controls effectively.

4. Respiratory Effects: G-forces can make breathing more challenging, especially during high-G maneuvers. The increased pressure on the chest can make it difficult to inhale and exhale properly, potentially causing shortness of breath or respiratory distress.

5. Disorientation and Spatial Disorientation: Rapid changes in G-forces can cause disorientation, making it difficult for pilots to accurately perceive their orientation in space. This can lead to spatial disorientation, where the pilot may lose their sense of up and down, roll, or pitch. Proper training and reliance on flight instruments can help pilots overcome these challenges.

### Shooting the Shit with ChatGPT
Me: I'm making a videogame about WWII dogfighting and I'm struggling to figure out what the best way is to classify the planes. The classification I have come up with includes light fighters, medium fighters, and bombers. Light fighters are small and extremely maneuverable but have less health, smaller fuel capacity, and only one type of gun. Medium fighters are less maneuverable and slower than light fighters but carry two to three gun types, have more fuel and more health. Medium fighters can act as dive-bombers and reconnaissance planes. Heavy bombers (or just bombers) are very large and very difficult to maneuver. They carry a wide array of guns but they primarily carry a large mass of bomb payloads. 

Small fighters are used for the purposes of aerial combat/dogfighting, and reconnaissance.
Medium fighters are used for the purposes of dive-bombing, dogfighting, and reconnaissance.

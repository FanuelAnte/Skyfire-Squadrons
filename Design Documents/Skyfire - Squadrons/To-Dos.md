- [ ] Fuel.
	- [x] burn rates
	- [x] throttle toggle PC
	- [x] throttle toggle Android
	- [ ] flight disable and coasting (this comes after death is implemented.)
		- [ ] If coasting, turning costs you speed. Therefore you need to be frugal with the maneuvers you make. coasting speed starts off at the base speed, if coasting, there is no throttling, and coasting speed gradually decreases if just flying in a straight line, and dramatically if maneuvering and turning, If coasting speed reaches zero, you either crash into the ocean on on land or somewhere. 
	- [x] UI indicator for time and fuel
- [x] Make the enemies not target the same player. The is_targeted flag did nothing.
- [ ] Either multi-targeting or random flight pattern towards action zones.

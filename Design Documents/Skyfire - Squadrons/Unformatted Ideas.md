# Core Gameplay Pillars
## Flight
This is the most basic and essential gameplay mechanic. This involves:
1. Steering
2. Diving
3. Climbing
4. Evasive maneuvers
The game exists on a 2D plane and that is a blessing and a curse: Easy pick-up and play controls, but restricted movement when it comes to diving and climbing. To fix this, the game is going to exist on two separate planes: below the clouds and above the clouds.
#### Above the clouds
This is the plane where most plane-to-plane combat takes place. You are still vulnerable to ground attacks but it's about **25%** chance of getting hit by ground units. From this position, you cannot attack ground units using your main mounted artillery such as machine guns. You can only use your bombs and torpedoes.
#### Below the clouds
This is where you are completely vulnerable to ground attacks. You are beneath the clouds therefore your visibility to the planes above the clouds is limited and you are invulnerable to their attacks. You can attack ground units using your mounted artillery as well as bombs and torpedoes. 
## Combat
This is the other essential gameplay mechanic. This involves:
1. Basic plane-to-plane dogfighting
2. Targeting and attaching **ground units**

> What if diving is like a toggle switch? What if if you're on the lowest level (below clouds), you kamikaze it and dive continually downwards. this requires extremely careful timing because ground troops don't miss often while you're diving. You can shoot while diving.
> And climbing on the highest level is like you pulling up infinitely until your stall. This can be an evasive maneuver of sorts but leads to engine failure if overdone. You can shoot while climbing.

> Scouting missions where you have  to fly under the radar and gather intel without being detected.

> overheating weapons.

> Assisted targeting based on an area cone.

> I don't know what to do with the controls. Instantaneous turning? Variable Speed?

> Aircraft carriers, submarines, AA guns, Navy Ships.

> Bullets have owners to signify who shot them to allow for identification of who got the kill.

> Use the parallax effect set at different values to determine the height of the plane instead of the scale of objects.
